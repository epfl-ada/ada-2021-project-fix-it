## Title : Discovering popularity of famous american politicians 

## Abstract

In the 21st century media coverage is a crucial factor for political figures. Studying the number of times a certain politician is quoted in a media, we can have a rough measure of how much interest does the media adress to this politician.
In our analysis we will study the evolution of the number of citations of some of the most important american politicians over the last few years and we will compare their evolution to some of the most important events in their carreer. We will then associate each speaker who quoted the politician to his nationality in order to show which countries are interested the most by the above mentioned political figure.

## Research Questions


## Proposed Dataset

The Quotebank dataset wil be used jointly with Special attributes dataset.

## Methods

* Filter quotes by person:
  - For each politician we look for his surname in each quote in the dataset.
  - We filter again the result removing all the quotes whose author is the politician himself and removing also all the quotes which can be attributed to someone with the same surname but not to the politician directly (for example Melania Trump)
 
* Analysis of the result
  - We plot the time series of the occurances for different politicians and for different period of times trying to analyse which 
  
* Analysis of media approval rating:
  - Compute the distribution and polarization metrics for each (person, timestamp)
  - Relate it to important event in the political career of said person
  - Compute a statistical test to see if two samples came from the same distributions (before and after a important political event)
