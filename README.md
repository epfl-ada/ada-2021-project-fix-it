## Title : Discovering popularity of famous american politicians 

## Abstract

In the 21st century media coverage is a crucial factor for political figures. Studying the number of times a certain politician is quoted in a media (in our case New York Times), we can have a rough measure of how much interest does the media adress to this politician.
In our analysis we will study the evolution of the number of citations of some of the most important american politicians over the last few years and we will compare their evolution to the most important events in their carreer in order to see if there is any causation or correlation. We will then add some more analysis distinguishing the speakers (who quoted a certain politician) by religion, nationality and political party in order to have a better and fragmented view of the causal effects. We will compare our work with Google Trends in order to see if the results actually match.

## Research Questions


## Proposed Dataset

The Quotebank dataset will be used jointly with Special attributes dataset.

## Methods

* Filter quotes by person:
  - For each politician we look for his surname in each quote in the dataset.
  - We filter again the result removing all the quotes whose author is the politician himself.
 
* Analysis of the result
  - We plot the time series of the occurances for different politicians and for different periods of time trying to analyse which are the events in the life of a politician which cause the politician to be quoted more over a certain period.
  - We will then tell the story of the american political scene from a mediatic point of view, comparing the evolution of the distribution of the main american politicians over the years 2015-2020.
  - We will compare our results to Google Trends in order to see if there is any match between the number of quotes linked to a certain politician and how much is he/she searched on google. We expect the two distribution to be similar but not the same since some scandal/events can have different a impact on different types of media (the user base of Google is quite different from the reader base of New York Times). 
  - We will merge the QuoteBank dataset with the special attribute dataset in order to understand important information on the people who quoted a given politician. For example we could analyse how the timeseries distribution of occurence of a given politician in a quote is different in different age groups, religion groups and political parties.
