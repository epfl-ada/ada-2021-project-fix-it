    "As we have explained in the notebook Map Dates, we have used the dataset Quotebank (article centric data) at the link https://zenodo.org/record/4277311#.YYrXTWDMJPY in order to recover the dates of each quote in the Quotes dataset (quotes centric data). The procedure consisted in the following steps:\n",
    "- We filtered the Quotebank (article centric) dataset keeping rows of the chunks corresponding to the articles which contained a quote containing the words Trump or Clinton.\n",
    "- We then read the file created in the notebook filter_quotes containing all the quotes (from the quotes centric data) containing the word Trump. We call this dataframe df_Trump for the sake of simplicity.\n",
    "- We look for the quoteID corresponding to the above mentioned quote in the filtered Quotebank (article centric) dataset and we extract the date of the articles in which the quoteID appears.\n",
    "- We create a new row in the dataframe df_Trump containing a list of dates in which the quotation appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we expected at the beginning was to find a perfect match between the number of occurences in the quotes centric dataset and the number of dates found by the procedure above. However, we have soon discovered that this was not the case. In fact there were some rows with less dates than number of occurrences as we can see in the notebook Map Dates. This could not be a problem when the same quote appear more than one in the article: in this case the date is just one (the date of the article) while the number of occurrences is more than one. However we discovered that there were quotes which had a positive number of occurrences but zero dates. For instance, the quote with quoteID = \"2019-02-10-028331\" has number of occurrences =2 but zero dates were found (it means that we did not find an article related to this quote) as it is shown below."

    "We tried to understand if the problem was related to the code or if it was an issue of the dataset and we discovered that the same quote could not be found in the whole 2019 dataset of Quotebank (article centric data) which should contain all the articles of 2019 and all the quotes in these articles. The verification that the exact quote could not be found was made using the following code.Since there is no output printed it means that the quoteID was not present in the Quotebank article centric dataset and so there is not a problem with the code but with the dataset. We will solve this problem filling the missing dates with one date (the date of the first occurrence which can be found in the first characters of quoteID)"
